# Pattern synthesizer

`core/pattern_synth.py` implements deterministic pattern generation for the demo instruments.

## Rhythm generation

Rhythms are built from a meter-aware step grid. The helper `_steps_per_bar`
derives how many sixteenth-note subdivisions live in a bar and the `euclid()`
function spreads a requested number of pulses evenly across that grid.
Additional events (such as hi-hat accents) come from `probability_grid`, which
samples Boolean hits from supplied probabilities.

## Markov or sequence logic

Each generator receives a dedicated random number generator seeded via
`_seeded_rng(seed, section, instrument)`. The current implementation samples
events independently, but the signature makes it easy to swap the inner loop
with a Markov chain that conditions the next state on the previous one.
Maintaining the generator between calls allows reproducible stateful behaviour.

## Density mapping

`SongSpec.density_curve` provides values in the range 0-1. Those values control
how many pulses are requested or how likely extra notes become:

- Drums: `pulses = max(1, int(round(1 + density * 3)))`
- Bass: `pulses = max(1, int(round(1 + density * 2)))`
- Keys: `pulses = max(1, int(round(1 + density * 3)))`
- Pads: triggered when `rng.random() < density + 0.1`

Higher density therefore increases the number of rhythmic hits or the
probability of ornamental notes.

## Extension hooks

The module is intentionally small so it can be extended:

- Add a new `gen_foo()` function following the existing instrument generators.
- Inside `build_patterns_for_song` register the new part with `_seeded_rng` to
  obtain a deterministic RNG and append the events to the section plan.
- Replace the probability grids with a Markov transition table or other
  rhythmic logic as needed.

These hooks keep the core deterministic while allowing more sophisticated
algorithms to be plugged in later.
