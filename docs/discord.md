# Discord Configuration

Set the bot token before launching ``discord_bot.py``. Blossom first checks the
``DISCORD_TOKEN`` environment variable and then looks for a ``secrets.json``
file (the desktop app's **Settings > Discord** page mirrors these steps).

```bash
export DISCORD_TOKEN="your_bot_token"
python discord_bot.py
```

Alternatively, create ``secrets.json`` in the project root or in the app data
directory (``%APPDATA%/com.blossom.musicgen`` on Windows,
``~/Library/Application Support/com.blossom.musicgen`` on macOS, or
``~/.local/share/com.blossom.musicgen`` on Linux):

```json
{
  "discord": {
    "botToken": "your_bot_token",
    "guildId": "optional guild id"
  }
}
```

If you prefer a text file, ``config.discord_token.set_token`` will write the
token to ``config/discord_token.txt``, which is also checked at runtime.

The Discord bot reads command permission rules from `config/discord.yaml` on startup.
Each top-level key in the file is the name of a slash command (use the full
`group subcommand` name for grouped commands). Every command maps to two lists:

- `channels` - channel IDs where the command is allowed. If omitted or empty,
  the command may be used in any channel.
- `roles` - role IDs permitted to invoke the command. If omitted or empty,
  any member may use the command regardless of role.

Example configuration:

```yaml
npc:
  channels: [1234567890]
  roles: [111111]

lore:
  channels: [1234567890]
  roles: []

"scene as":
  channels: [222222]
  roles: [333333]
```

In the example above `npc` can only run in channel `1234567890` by members with
role `111111`. The `lore` command is restricted to the same channel but has no
role requirement. Grouped commands such as `scene as` use their qualified
command name as the key.

## Live chat troubleshooting

The desktop Live Chat surface uses Whisper to transcribe Discord voice captures
before forwarding them to the NPC pipeline. On Windows, recordings longer than
one or two seconds previously triggered `os error 206` because the raw audio was
embedded directly in the Python command line. The transcription helper now
writes the audio buffer to a temporary file and passes that path to the Python
runtime, ensuring long captures transcribe successfully. If you still see the
error after updating, delete any leftover `blossom_whisper_*.pcm` files from
your temp directory and relaunch the app to regenerate them.
